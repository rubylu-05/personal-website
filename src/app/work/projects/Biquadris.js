          The process of developing Biquadris was a deep dive into object-oriented programming. Before writing a single line of code, our team invested significant time in designing a detailed UML diagram to map out class relationships, responsibilities, and interactions. This upfront planning paid off; by agreeing on architecture early, we avoided major refactoring headaches later and could work in parallel without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes. We spent a lot of time thinking about good design, so this project also reinforced the benefits of encapsulation and loose coupling for making teamwork smoother. After implementing the core game mechanics, I had the opportunity to enhance the project with bonus features. I grew up playing Tetris, so I ended up having a lot of fun with refining the design of the game and adding features. We ended up earning a 106% final grade on the project, which I was pretty happy about! The experience not only strengthened my skills with C++ but also deepened my appreciation for clean, scalable design.
