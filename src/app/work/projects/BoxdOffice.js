          This project was a really fun way to combine my personal interests into a tangible product. I thought about what kind of insights would actually be meaningful to someone who watches a lot of movies and how to present those insights in a way that's both informative and enjoyable to look at. Letterboxd doesn't have a public API, so I turned to web scraping with Beautiful Soup. This meant I had to be careful with rate limits; I accidentally exceeded them at one point, but this helped me implement better error handling and request throttling in the final version. On the front-end side, I put a lot of effort into mimicking Letterboxd's UI to make the dashboard feel like a natural extension of the platform. Streamlit's convenience was a blessing for rapid prototyping, but its limitations forced me to get a little creative with injected HTML/CSS to achieve the exact look that I wanted. There's a lot of room to improve and expand the project, but overall I'm happy with how it turned out, and it was super satisfying to bring the idea to life.
