          In <span className="text-[#ccb89f]">winter 2025</span>, I interned at <strong>Hatch</strong> in their Niagara Falls office, where I dipped my toes into the complexities of hydropower optimization. I worked to improve the efficiency of hydroelectric dams and explored the use of machine learning for predicting water inflow - I found this experience to be a really interesting intersection of engineering, sustainability, and software.
